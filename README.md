# 🔥Torch 2D game

# About

When I began programming more than ten years ago, creating simple games made me really happy. Even though I'm not a big
gamer, working on games was a small but important part of my life as a programmer.

I want to reignite that spark. Literally, because the game idea I have involves fire in some way. This repository is
taking part in the [100commitow](https://100commitow.pl) challenge. I've been thinking about making a game for a while,
and this contest seems like a good reason to start.

Why Kotlin, you might ask? Kotlin for games?! Well, I'd like to get to know this language better. I'm not sure if making
a game is the best way to do it, but crafting a small game will definitely be enjoyable for me. I stumbled upon an
interesting game engine ([KorGE](https://korge.org)), so... let's give it a try!

To keep things simple and organized, I'm using this README file for planning and notes. Right now, it seems like a good
way to manage the project, but things might change later on.
